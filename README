DESCRIPTION
Text files that do not have "hard" word wrapping via embedded line breaks can
be cumbersome to edit in a wide editor window, as it is strenuous on the eyes
to jump back and forth between begin and end of the soft-wrapped lines.
The simplest solution is to resize the editor window (:set columns=80), but
one may still want to have the large editor size for other edited buffers that
benefit from the large screen real estate.

This plugin places an empty padding window next to the current window, thereby
reducing its size while maintaining the overall editor size.

USAGE
:LimitWindowWidth [{width}]
                        Limit the window width of the current window by placing
                        an empty padding window to the right. If there already
                        is a padding window, its size is adapted according to
                        'textwidth' / {width}, or removed if the width is so
                        large that no padding is needed.
